* FindReagents addon for WoW

Given a selected tradeskill, this addon can be commanded to list the base materials needed to craft it, or craft a recipe given the materials exist.

* Usage

The listing of the items for a selected recipe is requested with:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
	/fr [<number>]
#+END_SRC

where <number> is the quantity of the item for which you need the ingredients. It is optional, with default value of 1.

If these ingredients are present in your inventory, they can be combined to make a desired amount of the item selected with:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
	/fr make <number>
#+END_SRC
