* FindReagents addon for WoW

Given a selected tradeskill, this addon can be commanded to list the base materials needed to craft it, or craft a recipe given the materials exist.

* Usage

The listing of the items for a selected recipe is requested with:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
	/fr [<number>]
#+END_SRC

where <number> is the number of items you want to make. It is optional, with default value of 1.

If these base items are present, they can be combined to make a desired amount of items of the selected tradeskill with:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
	/fr make <number>
#+END_SRC
